# Phantom Development
## Developers: Zuke
### Project Started 12/9/2022

Welcome to Phantom! A project inspired by my old project, ZeroDay. As known, ZeroDay was a little bit
clunky and slow, so we are seeking to resolve those issues with Phantom. Because Phantom is a brand new
project, we are able to use all of Discord's new features such as buttons, dropdowns, etc to make it
easier to use for everyone! Gone are the days of clunky bots which have loads of useless features
in them. Phantom will be 100% a moderation bot with no other bloat on it. We will focus on ease of use
and how efficient it will be, in order to beat out our competition. This page is for viewing current
issues that need to be resolved, and to view our [project board](/../../projects) of ToDo's, in-progress, along with completed
items. If you have an issue that you want to submit, please join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/G3473q2NsE)
to submit the request into the [Issues Page](/../../issues).
